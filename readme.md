# VELOCITY | Luxury Sneaker Storefront

A minimalist, high-performance e-commerce interface designed to look like a premium fashion editorial.

**The Goal:** I built this project to master raw **DOM manipulation** and **Advanced CSS** layouts without relying on frameworks like React or libraries like Bootstrap. It demonstrates that I can build complex, interactive UI features from scratch.

## 🔗 Live Demo

[(https://velocity-storefront.vercel.app/)]

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Cart System:** A fully functional cart built with Vanilla JS. You can add items, remove them, and see the total update instantly.
- **Data Persistence:** The cart saves to `localStorage`, so if you refresh the page, your sneakers are still there (mimicking a real backend).
- **Masonry Layout:** Used CSS `column-count` to create a "Pinterest-style" staggered grid for the products, rather than a standard boring table.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Instant category filtering and price sliders that update the DOM in real-time.
- **Zero Dependencies:** No node_modules, no build steps, just pure performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Design:** CSS Variables, Flexbox, CSS Grid
- **Assets:** Unsplash (High-res imagery)

## 💻 How to Run Locally

Since this project uses ES6 modules and modern web features, it works best when run on a local development server (opening the file directly can sometimes cause image loading or script issues).

### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/swaroop999/velocity-storefront.git](https://github.com/swaroop999/velocity-storefront.git)
    ```
2.  Open the folder in **VS Code**.
3.  Install the **"Live Server"** extension (by Ritwick Dey) if you haven't already.
4.  Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
5.  The project will launch automatically in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

### Option 2: The Simple Way

1.  Download or Clone the repository.
2.  Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.
    - _Note: Some features might behave differently depending on your browser's local file security settings._
